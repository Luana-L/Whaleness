## Inspiration

There are 1.7 million cases of sepsis in the USA each year, and it contributes to over 270,000 deaths. As many as 20% of sepsis patients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged, usually due to complications from the infection. After researching into, we found that communication breakdown between healthcare providers and patients contributed largely to this statistic: many patients are unaware of the proper recovery procedures or that occurring issues may be leftover complications from sepsis. Likewise, doctors and healthcare providers may be unaware of previous sepsis diagnoses and fail to get a proper understanding of the patient’s condition. By providing a centralized platform to connect providers with patients even after discharge, we hope to address this issue and mitigate the number of preventable sepsis cases and deaths.

## What it does

Whaleness serves to streamline the aftercare process for patients — from symptom tracking to notifying providers. Patients will be able to view treatment plans as prescribed by their healthcare providers and report any symptoms or concerns through the app. Whaleness also uses Apple Health data to identify irregular patterns in vital signs (e.g. heart rate, oxygen levels) to flag possible sepsis complications and notify healthcare providers. A messaging function is built into the app for direct communication between patients and providers.

## How we built it

We used Figma to create a rough mockup and prototype of Whaleness, modeling various views before building the app using Swift through Xcode. Our logo and mascot, Finley, was created in Adobe Illustrator after an initial round of brainstorming from the team.

We also worked with the Apple Watch to integrate Apple Health data into the platform, providing medical information used to track and identify possible patients at risk. ChatGPT was also integrated with the chatbot feature of Whaleness.

## Challenges we ran into

We had never developed a mobile app before, so we had to learn Swift fundamentals from scratch and figure out how to integrate our ideas into the app.

Our team also ran into issues running Xcode on our computers, requiring a lot of troubleshooting and reinstalling. We did our best to use our time efficiently by researching different functions we hoped to implement and refining the designs and user flow.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

We learned a lot about tenets of patient safety and sepsis —  but also a lot on the technical side as well. This was our first time working with outside APIs and integrating everything into one project.

As an app, we also learned a lot about user accessibility and user workflow. We wanted to make the app as simple and useful as possible, meaning we had a focus on user experience and interface.

## What's next for Whaleness

We're hoping to integrate support for maps connecting patients to specialists and doctors in their area. We also wanted to create more communication between patients and hospitals by updating doctor availability and appointment statuses on the patient’s side. Additionally, we developed Whaleness with sepsis in mind, but would love to generalize functions to fight other illnesses and conditions as well.
